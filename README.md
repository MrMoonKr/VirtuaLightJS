# VirtuaLightJS

A Physically Based Rendering engine created from scratch in WebGL2, compatible with at least Windows and Linux. (Smartphones not supported, can't test on macOS)

## Demo

Right here: https://virtualightjs.herokuapp.com/index.html

## Features

- Multiple meshes loading from .ply or .off files. Plys preferred as they provide UV textures.
- Individual control over meshes position, size and orientation through GUI.
- Multiple point lights with control over color, intensity and position through GUI.
- Fully Physically Based Shading of objects including albedo, metallic, ambient occlusion and roughness map.
- Normal mapping with TBM matrix computed on the fly by the graphic card.  
- Shadow Map for 1 light generated by simulating a directionnal light (WIP) with Percentage Closer Filtering
- Skybox transformed from equirectangular to cubemap at runtime
- Environnement based diffuse lighting with irradiance map baked on the fly from environnement map
- Specular IBL using split sum approximation by Epic Games (Unreal Engine 4) with precomputation at startup.
