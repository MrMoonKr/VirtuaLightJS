# VirtuaLightJS

A 3D engine created from scratch in WebGL2, compatible with at least Windows and Linux. (Smartphones not supported, can't test on macOS)

Current implementation features:
- Multiple meshes loading from .ply or .off files. Plys preferred as they provide UV textures.
- Individual control over meshes positions, size and orientation through GUI.
- Multiple point lights with control over color, intensity and position through GUI.
- Fully Physically Based Shading of objects including albedo, metallic, ambient occlusion and roughness map.
- Normal mapping with TBM matrix computed on the fly by the graphic card.  
- Shadow Map for 1 light generated by simulating a directionnal light (WIP)
